# US-Housing-Affordability

Business Statistics and Analysis Capstone
The project's data is sourced from the Housing Affordability Data System (HADS), which is administered by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. HADS stands for Housing Affordability Data System and consists of comprehensive datasets focusing on housing units. Its primary objective is to investigate housing unit affordability and the financial burdens faced by households in relation to various factors such as area median incomes, poverty level incomes, and fair market rent. This dataset serves the purpose of offering analysts a consistent means to assess affordability and cost burdens over an extended period.
These datasets are derived from the American Housing Survey (AHS) national files, starting from 1985. They encompass housing-level variables that include details on the number of rooms in housing units, the year of construction, occupancy status (rented or owned), unit type (single or multi-unit structure), the number of units within a building, the current market value of the unit, and a measure of relative housing costs. Furthermore, the dataset encompasses variables describing the number of occupants in a household, household income, and the residential area type (e.g., urban or suburban). All this data is accessible to the general public through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
For our project, we will specifically utilize data from the years 2005 onwards, which includes data from 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013.
